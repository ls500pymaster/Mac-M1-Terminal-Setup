You need to have Homebrew installed. Homebrew requires Command Line Tools for Xcode. But if you don't have it, the installation will install it for you.

**Basic installation**

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Run to check brew.
```bash
brew help
```

# iTerm2

**iTerm2** is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It works on Macs with macOS 10.14 or newer. iTerm2 brings the terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted.

**ZSH** is a shell designed for interactive use and it is also a powerful scripting language.
You can install it

    brew install zsh
Check 

    zsh --version

If your shell is not ZSH, run the following

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

Then restart your iTerm2 or open a new tab in iTerm2 and check it.

    echo $SHELL
